## **Deployment & Distribution**

- **Custom Linux Distro for Plug-and-Play**
  - [ ] Create a custom WSL Linux distro using WSL root filesystem tar files  
    (See [Microsoftâ€™s guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/build-custom-distro#what-are-wsl-root-filesystem-tar-files) for reference)

- **Public Access to RAG Services**
  - [ ] Enable secure access to the RAG pipeline from a public IP  
    (Implement necessary security measures such as VPNs or reverse proxies)
